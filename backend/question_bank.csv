What are the possible explanations for the climate change we are observing?,"What we are observing are only natural fluctuations in the climate, which have always been there and of which we also have evidence from paleo-climatic reconstructions carried out with the analysis of Antarctic ice cores.","What we are seeing is a climate change entirely caused by humans, whose activities have begun to interact with the global climate system since ancient times.","What we are observing is a climate change largely caused by human activities, especially those that, since the advent of the industrial age, have produced the emission of a large amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",,3

Why do we think that the CO2 emitted as a result of the use of fossil fuels and more generally of industrial activities is responsible for the climate change we are observing?,"Because CO2 is a greenhouse gas that interacts with the planet's energy balance by absorbing some of the Earth's radiation that the Earth emits into space. By increasing the concentration of CO2, human activities increase the ability of the atmosphere to absorb terrestrial radiation, thereby increasing its temperature.","Because CO2 is a greenhouse gas that interacts with the planet's energy balance by absorbing part of the solar radiation, which is the energy that powers the entire climate system. By increasing the concentration of CO2, human activities, therefore, increase the ability of the atmosphere to absorb solar radiation, causing warming.","Because CO2 is a pollutant that is emitted by burning fossil fuels and therefore poisons the atmosphere and, among other things, changes the planet's climate because it is released into the atmosphere at very high temperatures.",,1

For each of these different scenarios, emission pathways are then calculated that reflect the degree and manner of natural resource use.",,3
What are climate change projections?,They are future climate scenarios produced by climate models based on the greenhouse gas concentrations produced from emission scenarios corresponding to different socio-economic developments,"They are scenarios of plausible climate conditions for the future of the planet, which are used to calculate emissions scenarios.","They are future climate scenarios based on an extrapolation produced by models of the trend of climate change observed in the recent past, for the coming decades.",,1
