CMCC,Why do we think that the CO2 emitted as a result of the use of fossil fuels and more generally of industrial activities is responsible for the climate change we are observing?,"Because CO2 is a greenhouse gas that interacts with the planet's energy balance by absorbing some of the Earth's radiation that the Earth emits into space. By increasing the concentration of CO2, human activities increase the ability of the atmosphere to absorb terrestrial radiation, thereby increasing its temperature.","Because CO2 is a greenhouse gas that interacts with the planet's energy balance by absorbing part of the solar radiation, which is the energy that powers the entire climate system. By increasing the concentration of CO2, human activities, therefore, increase the ability of the atmosphere to absorb solar radiation, causing warming.","Because CO2 is a pollutant that is emitted by burning fossil fuels and therefore poisons the atmosphere and, among other things, changes the planet's climate because it is released into the atmosphere at very high temperatures.",,1,https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/causes/ ,Climate change fundamentals
